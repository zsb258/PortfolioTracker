Recommended environment:
1. Python 3.8+
2. Node.js 16 LTS

<br>

## Starting up
### 1. Start the server application
1. Run

    ```console
    $ bash start.sh
    ```

2. Keep this terminal running to provide data for the client UI

### 2. Start the client UI
1. Run on a new terminal
    ```console
    $ bash client.sh
    ```

2. Open [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in a browser to see the client interface

### 3. Publish events to see changes
These scripts emulate sending market data or trade events to the server, by periodically making POST requests to server, with event details as payload.
1. Run on a new terminal
    ```console
    $ python3 publish-market-data.py
    ```
2. Run on yet another terminal
    ```console
    $ python3 publish-trade-events.py
    ```

*The above scripts are written for `bash` on Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2), hence recommend using UNIX systems for compatibility.*
